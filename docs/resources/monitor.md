Manage a monitor.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a new event monitor
resource "impart_monitor" "test_event" {
  name                      = "terraform_event_monitor"
  description               = "test event monitor"
  notification_template_ids = [impart_notification_template.test.id]
  conditions = [
    {
      threshold   = 1,
      comparator  = "gt",
      time_period = 60000,
      delay       = 0,
      details = {
        type         = "event",
        action       = "api_access_token_created",
        subject_type = "api_access_token_id",
        actor_type   = "user_id"
      }
    }
  ]
}

# Create a new metric monitor
resource "impart_monitor" "test_metric" {
  name                      = "terraform_event_monitor"
  description               = "test event monitor"
  notification_template_ids = [impart_notification_template.test.id]
  conditions = [
    {
      threshold   = 1,
      comparator  = "lt",
      time_period = 60000,
      delay       = 0,
      details = {
        type = "metric",

- `details` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--conditions--details))
- `threshold` (Number) Number of occurrences that need to execute to have this condition be true.
- `time_period` (Number) In milliseconds, the time span from now until when we should be counting events (for example, 60000 is all events in the last minute).

### Nested Schema for `conditions.details`

Required:

- `type` (String) The type of monitor (should be one of 'event' or 'metric'
